# Week 5 — Templates Pack (Operational Artifacts)

## Purpose

Week 5 provides **copy-paste-ready templates** that turn this framework into an operating mechanism across Business, Engineering, Risk, Legal, and Platform teams.

These templates are designed to:
- reduce governance ambiguity
- standardize evidence capture
- accelerate approvals (without weakening controls)
- improve audit readiness and replayability

**Principle:** Readiness is not permission. Templates separate scoring readiness from hard permission gates.

## What’s Included

1. **Use-Case Intake Form**  
   `02_use_case_intake_form.md`

2. **Evaluation Scorecard (8 dimensions + weighting + calculation)**  
   `03_evaluation_scorecard_template.md`

3. **Hard Governance Gates Checklist (permission)**  
   `04_hard_governance_gates_checklist.md`

4. **Minimum Controls Checklist by Risk Tier**  
   `05_minimum_controls_checklist_by_tier.md`

5. **Audit Evidence Packet Template (what to capture, where, and how)**

## How to Use These Templates (Recommended Workflow)

1. **Intake**  
   Complete the intake form for the use case and proposed deployment context.

2. **Classify (Tier 1–3)**  
   Confirm tier classification using Week 1: Risk Classification.

3. **Score (Readiness)**  
   Use the scorecard template with Week 2 anchors and weighting matrix.

4. **Gate (Permission)**  
   Apply hard governance gates checklist. If any gate fails: **Block / Redesign**.

5. **Controls (Operationalize)**  
   Use controls checklist by tier to implement required technical and process controls.

6. **Evidence (Audit-ready)**  
   Use the audit packet template to capture proof of compliance.

7. **Change control**  
   Use recertification template whenever model/prompt/tool/policy changes occur.

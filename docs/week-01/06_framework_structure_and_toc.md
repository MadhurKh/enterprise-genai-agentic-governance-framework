# Framework Structure and Table of Contents

## Framework Structure

This repository contains the **Enterprise GenAI & Agentic AI Governance and Evaluation Framework**, organized as a practical set of enterprise-ready artifacts.

The framework is structured to move from:

- Scope and principles
- Risk-based classification
- Evaluation dimensions
- Decision and approval logic
- Scoring rubric, architecture, and worked examples

This structure aligns with **European enterprise governance best practices**, where accountability, proportional controls, and auditability are foundational.

# Evaluation Dimensions

## Purpose of the Evaluation Framework

Enterprise GenAI and Agentic AI systems must be evaluated on **more than technical performance**.

This framework assesses AI systems across business, risk, governance, and operational dimensions to determine suitability for:

- Enterprise deployment
- Controlled pilot
- Redesign or rejection

---

## Evaluation Dimension Overview

All GenAI and Agentic AI use cases are evaluated across **seven core dimensions**.

| # | Dimension |
|--|----------|
| 1 | Business Value & ROI |
| 2 | Risk & Compliance Exposure |
| 3 | Reliability & Determinism |
| 4 | Governance & Auditability |
| 5 | Security & Data Handling |
| 6 | Agentic Safety & Control |
| 7 | Operational Readiness |

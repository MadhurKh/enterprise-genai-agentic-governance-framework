# Decision and Approval Logic

## Purpose

This section ensures that evaluation outcomes translate into **clear, enforceable enterprise decisions**.

---

## Decision Outcomes

Every AI use case results in one of the following:

- **Approve**
- **Pilot with Controls**
- **Block / Redesign**

No use case may proceed without a documented outcome.

## Outcome Definitions

### Approve
- Acceptable risk for the tier
- Governance controls implemented
- Ownership confirmed

### Pilot with Controls
- Restricted scope
- Mandatory HITL
- Time-bound pilot
- Re-evaluation required

### Block / Redesign
- Unacceptable risk
- Insufficient governance
- Disproportionate impact

### Tier 2

## Accountability Model

Every AI system must define:

# Scope and Positioning

## Purpose of This Framework

The **Enterprise GenAI & Agentic AI Governance and Evaluation Framework** is designed to help organizations **evaluate, govern, and safely operationalize** Generative AI (GenAI) and Agentic AI systems at enterprise scale.

The framework provides a structured decision-making approach that balances:

- Business value
- Risk and compliance exposure
- Reliability and operational readiness
- Accountability and human oversight

Its primary objective is to ensure that GenAI and Agentic AI systems deliver **measurable value** while remaining **controlled, explainable, and auditable** in real-world enterprise environments.

---

## Scope of Applicability

This framework applies to:

- Internal enterprise GenAI solutions
- Client-facing AI products and platforms
- Agentic AI systems with partial or conditional autonomy
- AI systems that influence decisions, recommendations, or actions

It is intended for use by:

- AI product and platform owners
- Digital transformation leaders
- Enterprise architects
- Risk, legal, and compliance teams
- Operations and governance stakeholders

---

## Out of Scope (By Design)

This framework does **not** govern:

- Research-only or experimental AI prototypes
- Academic benchmarking of AI models
- Open-ended consumer chatbots with no business impact
- Pure data science model performance optimization

These exclusions are intentional to maintain **enterprise relevance and decision clarity**.

---

## Core Design Principles

This framework is built on the following principles:

1. **AI must be accountable**  
   Every AI system must have a clearly defined human owner responsible for outcomes.

2. **Risk awareness precedes automation**  
   Higher autonomy requires stronger governance, not greater trust.

3. **Human oversight is mandatory for high-impact decisions**  
   Decisions with legal, financial, or customer impact require human-in-the-loop controls.

4. **Explainability matters more than accuracy alone**  
   AI outputs must be interpretable by business, legal, and operational stakeholders.

5. **Fail-safe behavior is non-negotiable**  
   AI systems must default to escalation when confidence, data quality, or context is insufficient.

# Enterprise GenAI & Agentic AI Governance and Evaluation Framework

This repository contains a practical, enterprise-ready framework for evaluating, governing, and safely operationalizing **Generative AI (GenAI)** and **Agentic AI** systems.

The framework is aligned with **European enterprise governance best practices**, emphasizing risk proportionality, accountability, auditability, and controlled autonomy—rather than experimental or hype-driven AI adoption.

It is designed for leaders responsible for **owning AI decisions**, not just building AI solutions.

---

## Why This Framework Exists

As GenAI and Agentic AI move from experimentation into core enterprise workflows, organizations face critical questions:

- Which AI use cases are acceptable to deploy?
- How much autonomy is safe—and when?
- What governance controls are mandatory?
- Who is accountable when AI decisions go wrong?
- How do we balance innovation with regulatory and reputational risk?

This framework provides **clear, decision-ready answers** to those questions.

---

## Scope

This framework applies to:

- Enterprise GenAI applications (internal or client-facing)
- Agentic AI systems with bounded or conditional autonomy
- AI systems influencing decisions, recommendations, or execution
- Regulated or high-impact business environments

**Out of scope by design:**
- Research-only prototypes
- Academic model benchmarking
- Open-ended consumer chatbots
- Vendor-specific or proprietary implementations

### 📁 Upcoming Sections (Planned)

**Week 2 — Scoring & Readiness Rubric**
- Scoring scale and weighting model
- Dimension-level scoring anchors
- Decision thresholds (Approve / Pilot / Block)
- Mandatory control gates by risk tier

**Week 3 — Reference Architecture**
- Enterprise GenAI reference architecture
- Agentic AI reference architecture
- Schema contracts (inputs, outputs, evidence, logs)
- Escalation, failure modes, and kill-switch patterns

**Week 4 — Worked Example**

---

## Intended Audience

This framework is intended for:

- Heads of AI / GenAI / Digital Transformation
- AI Product and Platform Owners
- Enterprise Architects
- Risk, Compliance, and Legal stakeholders
- Consulting and advisory leaders working in regulated environments

---

## How to Use This Framework

The framework can be used as:

- A **governance gate** for approving AI use cases
- A **decision lens** during AI productization
- A **shared contract** between Business, AI, Risk, and Operations
- A **reference model** for responsible GenAI and Agentic AI adoption

It is intentionally tool- and vendor-agnostic.
